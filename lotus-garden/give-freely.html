                <h3 class="traveler-title">The Most Idiotic Traveler in the World</h3>
                <p class="traveler">
                    There once was a traveler on a journey who kept getting tricked by people she came across. That
                    is why everyone calls her an idiot. The villagers all scam something from her. They swindle her
                    out of money and clothes, anything she has to give, but because the traveler is dumb, she doesn't
                    understand what's really happening. So when the villagers lie and tell her she's saving them, she
                    starts weeping. And she always tells them "I wish you peace and happiness" before she waves goodbye.
                    Before long she has nothing left and is too weak to continue traveling. Before the last person to
                    swindle something from her leaves, they say to the traveler, “Thank you. Here is a gift in return
                    for your generosity.” But that, too, was a lie. The so-called gift is just a piece of paper with
                    the word “idiot” written on it. Still the traveler weeps. “Thank you so much,” she says, “This is
                    the first gift I've ever received. I'm so very happy, and I'm forever grateful to you. I can never
                    repay you for your generosity.” Tears pour from her eyes, as the traveler passes away, dying in a
                    pool of her joyful tears."
                </p>
                <p class="traveler">
                    Most people will laugh at the travelor and call
                    her an idiot, but I don't. I think this girl is a
                    lovely person. It's a waste of time to worry about
                    what you might lose in life, and so the travelor
                    paid no mind to such things. How can we be a little
                    more like the Idiotic Travelor who gave freely
                    expecting nothing, and weeped with gratitude and
                    happiness at the smallest gift? How much more good
                    could we do in the world if we would not hesitate to
                    give what we have to help another in need?
