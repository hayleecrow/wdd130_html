                <p class="parable">
                    "...an old Chinese farmer lost his best stallion one day and his neighbor came around to express
                    his regrets, but the farmer just said, 'Who knows what is good and what is bad.' The next day
                    the stallion returned bringing with him 3 wild mares. The neighbor rushed back to celebrate with
                    the farmer, but the old farmer simply said, 'Who knows what is good and what is bad.' The
                    following day, the farmer's son fell from one of the wild mares while trying to break her in and
                    broke his arm and injured his leg. The neighbor came by to check on the son and give his
                    condolences, but the old farmer just said, 'Who knows what is good and what is bad.' The next
                    day the army came to the farm to conscript the farmer's son for the war, but found him invalid
                    and left him with his father. The neighbor thought to himself, 'Who knows what is good and what
                    is bad.'"

                    Everytime you are faced with a situation, you have a choice: to view the glass half full or half empty,
                    to trust God or trust your own understanding. If you try hard enough you can find something bad
                    about every situation, but at the same time if you try hard enough you can find something good about every
                    situation. We may not know why we are asked to face the situations presented to us, but we can choose
                    to trust that God has our best interests at heart and will make everything works out in the end.
                    "If it has not worked out yet, then it is not the end" (Tracy McMillion).
