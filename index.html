        Hello everyone! My name is Haylee Crow. I'm from the 
        Bay Area of California. I'm majoring in Mathematics and 
        minoring in Computer Science. This is my second semester 
        here at BYU-Idaho, but the system calls me a Sophomore 
        because of transfer credit I earned while I was in High 
        School. I have three younger brothers ages 7, 14, and 17, 
        no sisters. In my free time I am an avid reader; during 
        this past winter semester when I was off track I read 35 
        books in that time alone.
